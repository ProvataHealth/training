The new HIPAA Omnibus ("omnibus" means something with several volumes or chapters) rules that went into effect on 9/23/2013, amongst other changes, created a category of entities called subcontractors.

Previously HIPAA rules only defined two categories of entities - covered entities and business associates. Covered entities are basically providers, payers, and clearinghouses. Business associates are basically entities that work with covered entities to perform a service or services to store, transmit, and/or process PHI. The new HIPAA rules expanded the number of categories of entities by 50% with the addition of subcontractors; for those of us in health tech, we think this is a pretty big deal.

We encourage you to read the rest of the [rules](http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2013pres/01/20130117b.html), or at least one of the commentaries that covers them in more detail, to see about the other changes that are a part of the Omnibus rule.
